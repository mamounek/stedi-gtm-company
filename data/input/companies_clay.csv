,"Cohealo, Inc.","Cohealo is a technology company that helps health systems share medical equipment across facilities, so they can optimize spend, accelerate cash flow, and improve access to care.

We were founded on the belief that collaboration among hospitals, using technology, could dramatically improve financial and clinical results.

We zeroed in on the massive inefficiencies around medical equipment. A health system typically spends tens of millions on equipment purchases and rentals annually. However, average utilization of 42% means most capacity remains idle. One hospital’s new spinal surgical table may gather dust, while a nearby facility cancels procedures due to equipment issues – or sends patients away altogether.

Our solution combines a technology platform, analytics, and supporting logistics to make medical equipment available – anywhere and anytime – on-demand. Some call our approach the sharing economy or collaborative consumption. For us, it’s a step forward on our mission to make the best medical technology available to every patient on the planet.","Hospitals and Health Care","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Boston, MA","United States","cohealo.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/cohealo-inc-"

The platform was well received due to our full integration of the stop loss contract, robust financial reporting and stop loss reporting. It was not long before we were receiving data from 100+ different TPAs and 40+ different PBMs.

As the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) was passed and implemented, it has brought with it additional compliance requirements as well as an increased focus on fiduciary duty by the Department of Labor. This was the catalyst to our offering various other compliance services such as Mental Health Parity, RxDC Reporting, Air Ambulance Reporting & Gag Clause Attestation assistance.

The implications of this move is that Plan Fiduciaries will have increased scrutiny regarding their management of Medical Plan Assets. We see this scrutiny occurring both for Plan Sponsors as well as TPAs (who are often considered fiduciaries by the courts.)

For these reasons we launched various Claim Services to help meet those fiduciary duties including Dialysis Cost Containment, Subrogation and Stop Loss Claim Filing.","Insurance and Employee Benefit Funds","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Greenville, South Carolina","United States","healthcarereporting.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/benefits-over-beers"

,"FinPay, LLC","FinPay, LLC provides Patient Financial Management Solutions to assist healthcare providers in their strategy to manage the $400 billion in patient out-of-pocket medical expenses that has caused a massive spike in bad debt and lost revenue to providers nationwide. The continuing shift of financial responsibility to the patient for the cost of healthcare has forced healthcare providers to rethink their Patient Financial Management strategy.   FinPay's solution provides:
 1. Financial Clearance Policies that target and segment patients that pose a high financial risk to the provider and customized work flow for these high risk patients.  
2. Patient engagement at the point of care to educate patients about their financial obligations and to manage patient expectations on the billing and claims process.
3. An automated payments platform that offers patients more alternatives for payment. Our platform automates patient installment plans and consumer non-recourse medical loans, in addition to processing of traditional payment methods like credit/debit/HSA cards and checks. 
4. Compliance tools so providers are compliant with federal and state consumer protection laws.

FinPay's mission is to provide a patient financial experience that mirrors the high quality clinical care experienced by most patients.  

At the core of our programs is a change in conversation at the point-of-care. A conversation that starts with helping the patient understand their financial obligations.  A conversation that simplifies the process by giving patients what they want, more options to fit their household budget and more transparency.  A conversation that results in facilitating a payment program they can afford, and more importantly, one they have the best chance of actually paying.","Hospitals and Health Care","51-200 employees","Privately Held","King of Prussia, PA","United States","finpay.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/financial-payment-network-llc"

THE BUSINESS PROBLEM: The world’s aging population is driving a strategic opportunity to improve the healthcare system in the US and worldwide by encouraging Telehealth, ‘aging-in-place’ or ‘at home’ care.

We can add $5K-$15K of net new income per month to each practice!

•	Our executive team is involved in every audit, and our expert data review process triggers the creation of custom queries for ""best probable error"" selection, identifying more systemic errors and ensuring long-term savings for our clients.
•	We test areas such as benefit maximums and exclusions that could impact members if recovery is initiated, and we alert employers so they can make recovery decisions. You are in charge, and you determine which claims to recover. We work with your TPA to monitor collections and help negotiate credits or settlements.

,"Affinity Care of Maine","Considered to be the model for quality, compassionate care for people facing a life-limiting illness or injury, hospice and palliative care involves a team-oriented approach to expert medical care and pain management. Emotional and spiritual support is expressly tailored to the patient's needs and wishes, and support is provided for the patient's loved ones as well. At the center of hospice and palliative care is the belief that each of us has the right to die pain-free and with dignity, and that our families will receive the necessary support to allow us to do so. Hospice focuses on caring, not curing, and, in most cases, care is provided in the patient's home. Hospice services are available to patients of any age, religion, race, or illness.

Affinity Care Hospice was founded upon the concept of providing the best care by the best staff. We do not take your care lightly, and promise to keep you and your family informed and comfortable. Each member of our staff is wholeheartedly committed to the Affinity Care Hospice Pledge.

,"FirstLight Home Care of Metro Atlanta","We are a premium service provider of caring and trusted caregivers, that deliver loving and compassionate care in the comfort of your home. Our trained caregivers offer personal care and companion care services in the home or residence for seniors or any adult who could use a helping hand. We are a leader for in-home caregiving services for seniors in the Atlanta area.

I started this business with the mission to better the quality of life for my parents’ and grandparents’ generations.  Growing up, I was blessed to have been surrounded by a loving family, older relatives and friends who have inspired me to live my life to the fullest with a sense of a strong purpose. Today, my husband and I find myself as part of the “sandwiched” generation, where our responsibilities span caregiving for not only our children but also our parents who are in the golden years of their lives.  We have been quite fortunate to have relatively independent parents, however; millions of people are faced with the daunting task of providing caregiving for their older parents or family members as their primary responsibility.  We completely understand that while we may all want to do the right thing for our loved ones, many a times it is just not practical to be able to devote the time, energy and effort they truly deserve. Our senior generation were strong, productive and independent members of our society during their heydays, however they have come to a point in their lives where they have to rely upon us, as their family members and friends, for basic daily living activities or even just companionship. This experience can become rather frustrating for them (and us). But the best we can do is ensure that they are cared for with love, dignity and respect.  Giving love and care for our seniors has been my constant ethos and this life motto has transcended into our company’s Culture of Care. Above everything else, we have built an amazing team of “caregivers with a heart”.","Home Health Care Services","51-200 employees","Privately Held","Atlanta, Georgia","United States","firstlighthomecare.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/flhc-metroatl"

Jenny says, “I have a master’s in gerontology as well as a master’s in therapeutic recreation, and I’ve been working with seniors across Illinois for the past 25 years. I feel very fortunate that older adults have always been a part of my life: I even knew my great-grandparents and my great-aunts. Most importantly, both of my grandparents on my mother’s side and on my father’s side played a huge role in my life. In fact, my grandma and grandpa lived just down the street and I was fortunate to help care for them when they were coming to the ends of their lives.

“More recently, we lost my father-in-law and my mother-in-law, both to cancer. They were so young, and we were not ready. But we were able to bring hospice caregivers into their home, and they made such a difference in the care both Mom and Dad received. They worked with us to provide comfort, and they made Mom and Dad’s lives better. They made our lives better, too.”

Now, Jenny and her team at Amada NorthShore work hard to provide the same level of compassion in-home care services for other seniors and their families. As Jenny says, “I really have a passion for working with seniors, and I want to make a difference in your life — for you and your loved ones.”

,"Sweet Duck Cleaner","Yes, we’re a cleaning company. 
But not the boring kind...

Sweet Duck Cleaner was born from a spark of inspiration, a desire to shake up the cleaning industry, and the help of some very special teammates that I will talk to you later.

It all started with Cris. 
After 3 years running a successful cleaning business (4,000+ spotless properties cleaned, thank you very much), he hit a wall. 
The business was growing, but the routine? Too dull. Cleaning didn’t feel exciting anymore—he needed a change.

Enter Nicole.
A startup pro with a knack for managing people and a serious entrepreneurial itch, she saw Cris’s drive and knew they could create something unique together.

But the real magic began when I stepped in...
Hi, I’m The Ducker. 
CEO, creative genius, and mascot extraordinaire. 
With over 10,000 Duckleans (our trusty rubber duck crew). 
I had a mission: to keep my team busy and bring some fun to a typically dull industry.

Together, we turned “just another cleaning company” into Sweet Duck Cleaner: a professional cleaning service with a twist. 
Our Duckleans leave behind spotless spaces—and a little something extra. 
After every cleaning, one of our Duckleans stays behind as a reminder of the care we put into every job.

Since 2020, we’ve partnered with property managers, contractors, and businesses to clean properties across Florida. 
We deliver high-speed, high-quality service with a touch of humor and heart.

Ready to see what Sweet Duck Cleaner is all about?
 Shoot us a message (321) 204-8102 or visit https://sweetduckcleaner.com/ to book your first cleaning. 

We promise you’ll never look at cleaning the same way again.

eSaha𛰙eHealth𛰚 was formed—in 2017—as a global-scale effort to launch a disaster relief and recovery telemedical program that geared towards readily responding to the ongoing Syrian conflict that had left over 13 million civilians direly needing affordable and qualified medical care.

The program prompts a virtual rendition of « Doctors without Borders ». It leverages a perpetually high social network penetration to bridge the disconnect between marginalized groups—internally displaced individuals, forced migrants, asylum seekers, and undocumented immigrants—and health practitioners worldwide. With a decentralized digital medical hub, the infrastructure is far more adaptable to the unique telecommunication･network capacity and circumstantial needs of the aforementioned targeted demographic, thereby facilitating equitable healthcare access to even the hardest-to-reach of patients.

Patients can reach out—using their language of choice—to inquire about wide-ranging health concerns. Their medical histories will be collected in real-time and promptly thereafter securely relayed to authorized within-network providers for an asynchronous continuation of correspondence. Patients should then expect to receive a follow-up—within 24 hours—either requesting additional contextual details or contributing a definitive diagnosis, with a corresponding care management plan, to finalize the case.

We believe exceptional care goes beyond a checklist. That’s why our services are built around four essential pillars that guide every interaction, visit, and relationship:

 Personalized Care
Every individual is unique — and so is our care. We tailor every plan to the needs, routines, and preferences of our clients, whether they need a few hours a week or full-time support.

 Companionship
Isolation is one of the most overlooked challenges for seniors. Our caregivers provide not just hands-on help, but also genuine connection — conversation, encouragement, and emotional support.

 Safety & Support at Home
Falls, medication errors, and household hazards are real risks. We provide mobility assistance, reminders, and home safety awareness to help clients remain safe and confident in their own space.

 Peace of Mind for Families
Caring for a loved one can be overwhelming. We become part of your extended care team — keeping families informed, involved, and reassured every step of the way.

Our caregivers are carefully selected, trained, and matched with your loved one to ensure not only skill but also compatibility. We're also proud to be an Optum-approved provider, helping eligible veterans and surviving spouses access the care benefits they’ve earned through VA Community Care and Aid & Attendance.

We will care for your aging senior by simply being a companion through the aging process, as well as by providing ongoing support to both the patient and  family.

We give the elderly the reverence and care they deserve. 

The dying have specific fears and needs that need to be addressed at the end of life.  Most of us haven’t been raised in a society that openly discusses death as a natural part of life, so when we’re faced with mortality, we are unsure how to communicate our needs and desires.  This can lead to many challenges.  

You Are Not Alone End of Life Doulas have been trained to understand and meet the needs of the dying person and their loved ones.  We understand how to actively listen and hold space for the dying and their families to do the work needed to have a good death.","Home Health Care Services","Self-employed","Self Owned","Colonia, NJ","United States","yanaec.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/you-are-not-alone-elder-care-llc"

,"Granny NANNIES","Granny NANNIES is an American franchise Brand system specializing in assisting families with home care services for seniors. Headquartered in Longwood, Florida, the company through its network of independently owned and operated franchises help nearly 5,000 families across 9 states. Granny NANNIES is an alternative to nursing homes, referring private duty home care aides for a wide range of conditions that may affect daily life.

Granny NANNIES only refers Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) and Home Health Aides (HHAs) to provide care for loved ones whose family is located in distant states, those who desire special personal care for their loved ones and those who are no longer able to care for themselves. Granny NANNIES matches clients with private duty caregivers to provide care services in the home, hospital, assisted living facility or nursing home.

Professional caregivers are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or as needed. Granny NANNIES works in conjunction with Medicare and does not compete with Hospice services. Most private insurance and workers compensation are accepted.

Granny NANNIES was founded in 1990 when Rob and Kirsten Hodgson needed senior home care for Rob’s aging grandmother, Esther Dowding, 87 at the time. Rob initially planned to hire a caregiver for Esther, but due to a lack of service, it fell through.

They could not find competent, caring and affordable assistance that would allow Rob’s grandmother to stay in her Winter Park, Florida home. To avoid placing Esther in an assisted living facility, Rob and Kirsten moved from New Hampshire to take care of her.

Based on their own personal experience and to fill the void of senior home healthcare services in Central Florida, Rob and Kirsten started Granny NANNIES of North America. In doing so, they discovered that their focus should be on more than just home nursing care, as there was a lack of services available for others struggling with daily tasks.","Home Health Care Services","11-50 employees","Privately Held","LONGWOOD, FL","United States","grannynannies.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/granny-nannies"

You look through the images Google suggests, trying to figure out what the bump is. But there’s a problem – nobody in the pictures looks like you and nobody’s skin looks like yours.

And that’s precisely why I created Melalogic – so we can have viable skincare solutions for us (and by us).

Melalogic is a web app that harnesses the power of AI to give our community a source of skin health information from trusted professionals who look like us.

With this app, you gain instant access to key info about a host of skincare issues, including acne, eczema, razor bumps, keloids, sun damage, alopecia and various skin cancers.

As a Melalogic user, you’ll also help build the Black Skin Health AI Dataset while getting your skincare questions answered.

When you upload a photo of your skin issue, you’ll receive instant feedback about what your issue may be, as well as suggestions on how to treat it. 

PLUS, your photo will help build our AI dataset, which strengthens our AI and fuels our AI-powered dermatology research and pre-diagnoses, so you get an even better user experience.

AC Health is changing the way that medical and wellness professionals engage with their clients, patients and users. Our SaaS platform instantly creates ""playlists"" hosted on our IOS/Android App. No more paper printouts or time-consuming emails.

In one click, all of your patient/client uniquely personalized care content is pushed to their app. Patients want to watch and to listen to their trusted provider -- and now they can!

If you are a rehabilitation therapist, coach, nutritionist, trainer, teacher, health care instructor or any professional helping people recover and stay healthy, we want to help you stay connected to your clients and patients through what they use the most - their phone! AC Health is designed to make it affordable for you to essentially have your own app, without compromising on the customization that you require to serve your audience personally based on their unique needs.

Physical therapists can create personalized home exercise videos for their patients during their session in just 3 steps -- open the app, click the patient's name and take a private video of the exercise uploaded instantly. Each exercise can be moved and edited (reps, sets, frequency, intensity) dynamically inside the app. Adding and deleting exercises at subsequent sessions takes minutes allowing the PT to prescribe a unique exercise regimen for every patient, speeding up recovery. No more emailing or printing and re-printing sheets of paper. Patient compliance accelerates due the simple ""one click"" access to their HEP.

,"Premier Kids Home Care","At Premier Kids Home Care (PKHC), we’re on a mission to solve one of pediatric home care’s biggest challenges: access to care. We believe that every medically fragile child deserves consistent, high-quality nursing—and that families and nurses deserve real support, not just promises.

The pediatric private duty nursing (PDN) industry is vital yet often overlooked. Families are frequently approved for care they can’t access, and nurses are too often left without the support they need to thrive. We exist to change that.

Premier Kids Home Care was created to bridge the widening gap between authorized and actual staffed nursing hours. Through innovation, efficiency, and heart, we’re committed to moving the needle and reimagining what pediatric home care can look like.

Our approach is simple:

1. Empower nurses with the respect, communication, and flexibility they deserve.
2. Support families by listening, advocating, and being a trusted partner.
3. Innovate by using modern tools and streamlined systems to reduce inefficiencies.
4. Build culture that feels like home—combining the resources of a larger agency with the heart of a small, family-run team.

We’re not here to dwell on what’s broken—we’re here to build something better. With a leadership team that brings decades of combined experience in PDN, we’re focused on real solutions, long-term relationships, and a deep commitment to the people behind the care.

If you’re a nurse who wants to feel truly valued, or a family looking for a reliable, compassionate partner—you’ve found your place.

PRESS RELEASE 2022! Bioscience Pro is pleased to announce the 2022 release of our much anticipated proprietary early-stage medical device vetting investor service, SmartMed PRO. Only SmartMed PRO thoroughly investigates (QMS) Quality Management System compliance with 21 CFR 820 and ISO 13485:2016 to determine if the startup model has designed and implemented vital processes at the infancy of development. Our unique in-depth 50-point analysis provides a clear and concise evaluation to determine the viability of the medical device startup. SmartMed PRO is a service offered exclusively through Bioscience Pro Software Engineers, a company with 20 years of medical device regulatory experience.
“I developed SmartMed PRO as a response to 20 years of real-life medical device software engineering experience. Venture Capital organizations want to acquire disruptive technology for early-stage startups. Seed money investors risk millions based on this valued asset technology. Unfortunately, a long and drawn out FDA clearance path diminishes returns, increases costs, and leaves the door open for competitors.”

,"BIVE.AI","Summary
BIVE AI leverages advanced machine learning and computer vision to instantly verify people and businesses, providing accurate results based on real fraud signals. Experience unparalleled trust and security.

Founding story
We launched a payment processing platform (https://www.wafi.cash/) and quickly ran into the vast problem of identity theft. We swiftly looked around for a solution that could reliably help us identify when a business, an authorized rep or an individual is fake or fraudulent and we were unable to find anything reliable.

We quickly learned that many other businesses are dealing with this problem with a full-time compliance team with varying levels of success. Existing solutions are not only expensive and time consuming, but also unreliable.

We developed a large language AI model whose sole purpose is to help customers spot identity theft in a reliable and cost effective way. Now we are looking for a few customers to pilot the solution and give us feedback.

Problem:
Traditional identity verification falls short. By only validating input data, it allows fraudulent users to bypass security, putting your platform at risk.

Solution:
BIVE AI treats input data as an initial step. We then validate and analyze information across trusted web sources to definitively confirm not only a person's existence, but the accuracy of their claimed identity.

What makes BIVE AI Better?
We don't just check data; we validate it across trusted web sources to determine true identity.","Financial Services","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Dublin, CA","United States","bive.ai","https://www.linkedin.com/company/wafi"

As the model of healthcare shifts from reactionary to preventative, the specialty diagnostics industry will continue to be a high value partner to all industry stakeholders, including patients, clinicians, healthcare systems, and healthcare insurance companies.

Identifying a signal of disease progression as early as possible is a best practice. In the process of treating and managing the presence of the disease, it is vital to identify underlying and potentially hidden disease signals. Studies on over 400,000 patients show that Genotox will identify between 2-7% more cases of possible disease versus alternative diagnostic testing options.

While administrative, operational, and financial leadership has received a great deal of attention, solutions for physicians have been largely ignored. The Agathos approach for physician engagement with data is led by our team of data scientists and seven physician advisors. Our key differentiation is that physicians self-select into using Agathos with sustained engagement levels as high as 80%, without the need for administrative pressure or mandates.
