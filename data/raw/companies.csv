Dr. Vi is ViClinic’s AI-powered pre-visit assistant that collects structured symptom data, streamlines triage, supports accurate decision-making, saves time for both clinicians and patients. 
Unlike traditional EMRs that burden healthcare teams with complexity, ViClinic offers a clinician-first interface, customizable workflows, and cloud-based scalability to fit the specific needs of healthcare systems of any size. From intuitive patient documentation to automated pre-visit symptom collection, ViClinic frees up time for what matters most—quality care.
 Key Features:
•	Minimal-click documentation interface
•	Intelligent pre-visit symptom capture with AI
•	Customizable SaaS blocks for scalable deployment
•	HIPAA-compliant, IBM Cloud-powered infrastructure
•	Built-in support for hybrid care (in-person + telehealth)
•	Secure patient portal with records, appointments & chat
ViClinic EMR features a modular design with all essential clinical and administrative tools—built around patients and medical cases to enable seamless care team collaboration, communication, and coordination. All wrapped in a sleek, intuitive user experience tailored for busy clinical teams.
We work closely with hospitals and healthcare networks to deliver end-to-end implementation—from requirement gathering and system integration to training, migration, and ongoing support.
Let’s rethink EMR together—for better outcomes, lower burnout, and smarter healthcare systems.

We pride ourselves on having a high degree of technical expertise in benefits and blend that with high levels of client service.

Healthcare Reporting was originally founded in 2015 to address new compliance regulations required under the Affordable Care Act. Since that time the compliance and administration burden of our clients has continued to grow, and we have evolved to help meet those needs. 

Our next evolution occurred in 2017 when we released Self Insured Reporting, a Claim Reporting & Analytics technology that had been in the works for a decade prior. The platform was well received due to our full integration of the stop loss contract, robust financial reporting and stop loss reporting. It was not long before we were receiving data from 100+ different TPAs and 40+ different PBMs.

As the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) was passed and implemented, it has brought with it additional compliance requirements as well as an increased focus on fiduciary duty by the Department of Labor. This was the catalyst to our offering various other compliance services such as Mental Health Parity, RxDC Reporting, Air Ambulance Reporting & Gag Clause Attestation assistance.

The implications of this move is that Plan Fiduciaries will have increased scrutiny regarding their management of Medical Plan Assets. We see this scrutiny occurring both for Plan Sponsors as well as TPAs (who are often considered fiduciaries by the courts.)

For these reasons we launched various Claim Services to help meet those fiduciary duties including Dialysis Cost Containment, Subrogation and Stop Loss Claim Filing.",Insurance and Employee Benefit Funds,United States,11-50,2025-08-08 17:01:06+00:00,https://www.linkedin.com/company/benefits-over-beers,content,Webinar-EDI-Modern,AWS|Azure,HIPAA|X12|FHIR,FHIR API|HL7 V2|SOAP|REST,0.84,False,False,No evidence found of X12 transaction usage or clearinghouse services.,0.2

They are confusing, 40% of them contain errors, 17% of them are denied by insurance, and they can represent very large sums of money. As a result, 100 million Americans are saddled with healthcare debt, and medical bills cause nearly 70% of personal bankruptcies in the US.

Dealing with unexpectedly high medical bills is time-consuming, complex, and stressful. Stuck between their providers, payers, and bill collectors, consumers too frequently have to make numerous phone calls, wait on hold, and even send paper letters and faxes.

Thanks to AI and new healthcare regulations around data access and price transparency, we can now automate this soul-crushing work and empower consumers to fight back against this broken system. While our initial focus is on helping people once they’ve received a bill, we are ultimately committed to helping people through their entire healthcare journey as they look for care or change insurance plans.","Technology, Information and Internet",United States,11-50,2025-06-10 23:24:31+00:00,https://www.linkedin.com/company/medbill-ai,content,Webinar-EDI-Modern,AWS Lambda|Amazon S3|AWS RDS,X12|FHIR|HL7,REST API|Webhook,0.84,False,True,Utilizes X12 and API for healthcare data exchange; relevant use cases identified.,0.9

When coupled with our leading eCare21 app, we are driving to better outcomes and transforming how proactive care and care coordination is delivered. This isn’t easy, but our unique technology makes it seem simple.

OUR MISSION: eCare21’s mission is to improve the quality of life for everyone involved across the care continuum. 

OUR VISION: eCare21 will transform health care by introducing innovative technology and solutions that will dramatically improve the quality of life for everyone in our communities - one patient, one family at a time.

THE BUSINESS PROBLEM: The world’s aging population is driving a strategic opportunity to improve the healthcare system in the US and worldwide by encouraging Telehealth, ‘aging-in-place’ or ‘at home’ care. In the US, Seniors become eligible for Medicare at age 65. Currently, there are 58 million Medicare beneficiaries in the US and 10,000 seniors per day become newly eligible for Medicare every day for next 20 years! 

OUR SOLUTION: Our solution helps seamlessly document the non-face-to-face, patient-related, clinical activities performed by staff for Telehealth/RPM/CCM-eligible patients and generates the required clear, compliant documentation needed for billing with a proven ROI. We can add $5K-$15K of net new income per month to each practice! Our solution introduces administrative efficiencies that return up to 20% of a medical practitioner’s time to focus on higher priority items and improve their quality of life. Medical Billing and Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) companies also benefit from the increased revenue flow. It’s a win-win.

✓ Generate new revenue streams without hiring new staff

Our trained caregivers offer personal care and companion care services in the home or residence for seniors or any adult who could use a helping hand. We are a leader for in-home caregiving services for seniors in the Atlanta area.

I started this business with the mission to better the quality of life for my parents’ and grandparents’ generations.  Growing up, I was blessed to have been surrounded by a loving family, older relatives and friends who have inspired me to live my life to the fullest with a sense of a strong purpose. Today, my husband and I find myself as part of the “sandwiched” generation, where our responsibilities span caregiving for not only our children but also our parents who are in the golden years of their lives.  We have been quite fortunate to have relatively independent parents, however; millions of people are faced with the daunting task of providing caregiving for their older parents or family members as their primary responsibility.  We completely understand that while we may all want to do the right thing for our loved ones, many a times it is just not practical to be able to devote the time, energy and effort they truly deserve. Our senior generation were strong, productive and independent members of our society during their heydays, however they have come to a point in their lives where they have to rely upon us, as their family members and friends, for basic daily living activities or even just companionship. This experience can become rather frustrating for them (and us). But the best we can do is ensure that they are cared for with love, dignity and respect.  Giving love and care for our seniors has been my constant ethos and this life motto has transcended into our company’s Culture of Care. Above everything else, we have built an amazing team of “caregivers with a heart”.",Home Health Care Services,United States,51-200,2025-05-15 18:25:48+00:00,https://www.linkedin.com/company/flhc-metroatl,paid_social,PS-Meta-SMB,,HIPAA Compliance|HL7 Standards,,0.7,False,False,No evidence of using X12 transactions or API automation.,0.2

Jenny says, “I have a master’s in gerontology as well as a master’s in therapeutic recreation, and I’ve been working with seniors across Illinois for the past 25 years. I feel very fortunate that older adults have always been a part of my life: I even knew my great-grandparents and my great-aunts. Most importantly, both of my grandparents on my mother’s side and on my father’s side played a huge role in my life. In fact, my grandma and grandpa lived just down the street and I was fortunate to help care for them when they were coming to the ends of their lives.

“More recently, we lost my father-in-law and my mother-in-law, both to cancer. They were so young, and we were not ready. But we were able to bring hospice caregivers into their home, and they made such a difference in the care both Mom and Dad received. They worked with us to provide comfort, and they made Mom and Dad’s lives better. They made our lives better, too.”

Now, Jenny and her team at Amada NorthShore work hard to provide the same level of compassion in-home care services for other seniors and their families. As Jenny says, “I really have a passion for working with seniors, and I want to make a difference in your life — for you and your loved ones.”

But not the boring kind...

Sweet Duck Cleaner was born from a spark of inspiration, a desire to shake up the cleaning industry, and the help of some very special teammates that I will talk to you later.

It all started with Cris. 
After 3 years running a successful cleaning business (4,000+ spotless properties cleaned, thank you very much), he hit a wall. 
The business was growing, but the routine? Too dull. Cleaning didn’t feel exciting anymore—he needed a change.

Enter Nicole.
A startup pro with a knack for managing people and a serious entrepreneurial itch, she saw Cris’s drive and knew they could create something unique together.

But the real magic began when I stepped in...
Hi, I’m The Ducker. 
CEO, creative genius, and mascot extraordinaire. 
With over 10,000 Duckleans (our trusty rubber duck crew). 
I had a mission: to keep my team busy and bring some fun to a typically dull industry.

Together, we turned “just another cleaning company” into Sweet Duck Cleaner: a professional cleaning service with a twist. 
Our Duckleans leave behind spotless spaces—and a little something extra. 
After every cleaning, one of our Duckleans stays behind as a reminder of the care we put into every job.

Since 2020, we’ve partnered with property managers, contractors, and businesses to clean properties across Florida. 
We deliver high-speed, high-quality service with a touch of humor and heart.

Ready to see what Sweet Duck Cleaner is all about?
 Shoot us a message (321) 204-8102 or visit https://sweetduckcleaner.com/ to book your first cleaning. 

We promise you’ll never look at cleaning the same way again.

eSaha𛰙eHealth𛰚 was formed—in 2017—as a global-scale effort to launch a disaster relief and recovery telemedical program that geared towards readily responding to the ongoing Syrian conflict that had left over 13 million civilians direly needing affordable and qualified medical care.

The program prompts a virtual rendition of « Doctors without Borders ». It leverages a perpetually high social network penetration to bridge the disconnect between marginalized groups—internally displaced individuals, forced migrants, asylum seekers, and undocumented immigrants—and health practitioners worldwide. With a decentralized digital medical hub, the infrastructure is far more adaptable to the unique telecommunication･network capacity and circumstantial needs of the aforementioned targeted demographic, thereby facilitating equitable healthcare access to even the hardest-to-reach of patients.

Patients can reach out—using their language of choice—to inquire about wide-ranging health concerns. Their medical histories will be collected in real-time and promptly thereafter securely relayed to authorized within-network providers for an asynchronous continuation of correspondence. Patients should then expect to receive a follow-up—within 24 hours—either requesting additional contextual details or contributing a definitive diagnosis, with a corresponding care management plan, to finalize the case.

There’s also administrative support through the healthcare system, answers to healthcare questions and access to comprehensive medicine information.

Falls, medication errors, and household hazards are real risks. We provide mobility assistance, reminders, and home safety awareness to help clients remain safe and confident in their own space.

 Peace of Mind for Families
Caring for a loved one can be overwhelming. We become part of your extended care team — keeping families informed, involved, and reassured every step of the way.

KallyKare's founder, Jemima Kalala a wife and mother of three boys has worked in the field of caregiving for about 8 years, she met many seniors who had all sorts of needs, and every home she entered was blessed to have her around. She's a kind soul who has compassion for others and she loves her job she is very passionate about it. She hopes to make a positive impact in people's lives by giving seniors amazing memories to last them a lifetime. Mrs. Kalala had one focus and it was to give seniors and their families the comfort, trust, and care that they needed when leaving their loved ones in the arms of another person. Working under certain agencies wasn't giving her the environment she needed to stimulate her focus. She always enjoyed helping people and wanted to make a difference in her life and others.

Headquartered in Longwood, Florida, the company through its network of independently owned and operated franchises help nearly 5,000 families across 9 states. Granny NANNIES is an alternative to nursing homes, referring private duty home care aides for a wide range of conditions that may affect daily life.

Granny NANNIES only refers Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) and Home Health Aides (HHAs) to provide care for loved ones whose family is located in distant states, those who desire special personal care for their loved ones and those who are no longer able to care for themselves. Granny NANNIES matches clients with private duty caregivers to provide care services in the home, hospital, assisted living facility or nursing home.

Professional caregivers are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or as needed. Granny NANNIES works in conjunction with Medicare and does not compete with Hospice services. Most private insurance and workers compensation are accepted.

Granny NANNIES was founded in 1990 when Rob and Kirsten Hodgson needed senior home care for Rob’s aging grandmother, Esther Dowding, 87 at the time. Rob initially planned to hire a caregiver for Esther, but due to a lack of service, it fell through.

They could not find competent, caring and affordable assistance that would allow Rob’s grandmother to stay in her Winter Park, Florida home. To avoid placing Esther in an assisted living facility, Rob and Kirsten moved from New Hampshire to take care of her.

Based on their own personal experience and to fill the void of senior home healthcare services in Central Florida, Rob and Kirsten started Granny NANNIES of North America. In doing so, they discovered that their focus should be on more than just home nursing care, as there was a lack of services available for others struggling with daily tasks.",Home Health Care Services,United States,11-50,2024-09-02 11:00:37+00:00,https://www.linkedin.com/company/granny-nannies,outbound,OB-ABM-T1,,HIPAA|FHIR|X12,,0.65,False,False,No evidence of using X12 transactions or API automation found.,0.3

You look through the images Google suggests, trying to figure out what the bump is. But there’s a problem – nobody in the pictures looks like you and nobody’s skin looks like yours.

And that’s precisely why I created Melalogic – so we can have viable skincare solutions for us (and by us).

Melalogic is a web app that harnesses the power of AI to give our community a source of skin health information from trusted professionals who look like us.

With this app, you gain instant access to key info about a host of skincare issues, including acne, eczema, razor bumps, keloids, sun damage, alopecia and various skin cancers.

As a Melalogic user, you’ll also help build the Black Skin Health AI Dataset while getting your skincare questions answered.

When you upload a photo of your skin issue, you’ll receive instant feedback about what your issue may be, as well as suggestions on how to treat it. 

PLUS, your photo will help build our AI dataset, which strengthens our AI and fuels our AI-powered dermatology research and pre-diagnoses, so you get an even better user experience.

She went on to live 11 more vibrant years, reaching her 100th birthday while creating cherished family memories.

AC Health is changing the way that medical and wellness professionals engage with their clients, patients and users. Our SaaS platform instantly creates ""playlists"" hosted on our IOS/Android App. No more paper printouts or time-consuming emails.

In one click, all of your patient/client uniquely personalized care content is pushed to their app. Patients want to watch and to listen to their trusted provider -- and now they can!

If you are a rehabilitation therapist, coach, nutritionist, trainer, teacher, health care instructor or any professional helping people recover and stay healthy, we want to help you stay connected to your clients and patients through what they use the most - their phone! AC Health is designed to make it affordable for you to essentially have your own app, without compromising on the customization that you require to serve your audience personally based on their unique needs.

Physical therapists can create personalized home exercise videos for their patients during their session in just 3 steps -- open the app, click the patient's name and take a private video of the exercise uploaded instantly. Each exercise can be moved and edited (reps, sets, frequency, intensity) dynamically inside the app. Adding and deleting exercises at subsequent sessions takes minutes allowing the PT to prescribe a unique exercise regimen for every patient, speeding up recovery. No more emailing or printing and re-printing sheets of paper. Patient compliance accelerates due the simple ""one click"" access to their HEP.

We believe that every medically fragile child deserves consistent, high-quality nursing—and that families and nurses deserve real support, not just promises.

The pediatric private duty nursing (PDN) industry is vital yet often overlooked. Families are frequently approved for care they can’t access, and nurses are too often left without the support they need to thrive. We exist to change that.

Premier Kids Home Care was created to bridge the widening gap between authorized and actual staffed nursing hours. Through innovation, efficiency, and heart, we’re committed to moving the needle and reimagining what pediatric home care can look like.

Our approach is simple:

1. Empower nurses with the respect, communication, and flexibility they deserve.
2. Support families by listening, advocating, and being a trusted partner.
3. Innovate by using modern tools and streamlined systems to reduce inefficiencies.
4. Build culture that feels like home—combining the resources of a larger agency with the heart of a small, family-run team.

We’re not here to dwell on what’s broken—we’re here to build something better. With a leadership team that brings decades of combined experience in PDN, we’re focused on real solutions, long-term relationships, and a deep commitment to the people behind the care.

If you’re a nurse who wants to feel truly valued, or a family looking for a reliable, compassionate partner—you’ve found your place.

Our company was launched in 2016, after we noticed two troubling trends: healthcare provider review sites tended to cater to and attract patients of a higher socioeconomic status and many existing sites accepted financial compensation in exchange for removal of negative reviews.

Driven by a commitment to address these problems, we set out to make CareDash the most reliable and informative healthcare provider review site of its kind.

CareDash is here to ensure that you, the patient, feel informed and confident making important decisions about your health. In addition to useful provider information and unfiltered reviews, we present complex healthcare information and data in a comprehensive and easy-to-understand manner.

BIVE AI leverages advanced machine learning and computer vision to instantly verify people and businesses, providing accurate results based on real fraud signals. Experience unparalleled trust and security.

Founding story
We launched a payment processing platform (https://www.wafi.cash/) and quickly ran into the vast problem of identity theft. We swiftly looked around for a solution that could reliably help us identify when a business, an authorized rep or an individual is fake or fraudulent and we were unable to find anything reliable.

We quickly learned that many other businesses are dealing with this problem with a full-time compliance team with varying levels of success. Existing solutions are not only expensive and time consuming, but also unreliable.

We developed a large language AI model whose sole purpose is to help customers spot identity theft in a reliable and cost effective way. Now we are looking for a few customers to pilot the solution and give us feedback.

Problem:
Traditional identity verification falls short. By only validating input data, it allows fraudulent users to bypass security, putting your platform at risk.

Solution:
BIVE AI treats input data as an initial step. We then validate and analyze information across trusted web sources to definitively confirm not only a person's existence, but the accuracy of their claimed identity.

What makes BIVE AI Better?
We don't just check data; we validate it across trusted web sources to determine true identity.",Financial Services,United States,11-50,2025-05-23 22:26:21+00:00,https://www.linkedin.com/company/wafi,outbound,OB-Prospecting,AWS|Azure|Google Cloud Platform,HIPAA Compliance|X12 EDI|FHIR,RESTful APIs|Webhooks,0.9,False,True,"BIVE.AI focuses on HIPAA compliance and X12 EDI, indicating a strong fit for API-first healthcare integration.",0.85

Identifying a signal of disease progression as early as possible is a best practice. In the process of treating and managing the presence of the disease, it is vital to identify underlying and potentially hidden disease signals. Studies on over 400,000 patients show that Genotox will identify between 2-7% more cases of possible disease versus alternative diagnostic testing options.

Agathos CareReflect shows physicians how their practice patterns compare to those of peers in their facilities. This piques curiosity and sparks self-determined change that lowers the cost of care while improving quality, safety, and patient and provider experience.

Agathos was founded on the vision of making valuable care obvious and normal. A first-of-its-kind transparency platform, created by physicians for physicians, Agathos offers superior feedback on practice variation and scales the “last mile” of physician engagement through action-level peer comparisons, timely case examples, and a gamified mobile experience that builds physician trust and behavior change with time and use. We partner with health systems—maximizing the benefits of prior technology investments—to empower physicians toward ever-higher quality, cost stewardship, and organizational alignment.

What makes Agathos unique is our focus on meeting the data needs of the physician as the end user. While administrative, operational, and financial leadership has received a great deal of attention, solutions for physicians have been largely ignored. The Agathos approach for physician engagement with data is led by our team of data scientists and seven physician advisors. Our key differentiation is that physicians self-select into using Agathos with sustained engagement levels as high as 80%, without the need for administrative pressure or mandates.
